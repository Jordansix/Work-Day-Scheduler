# Work-Day-Scheduler
Showing that I can code a proper work day schedule

Added the starter code so I can start working on the work schedule.

Implamented the div class with all the times throughout my day.

Adding the defer attribute this way the script is only going to execute once the documnet has been loaded and so I wont run into errors.
